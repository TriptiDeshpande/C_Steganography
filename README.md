# Steganography Using Least Significant Bit (LSB) Technique

## Overview
This project implements a steganographic system using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** technique to securely embed and extract secret messages within digital images. 
The core objective is to maintain the visual integrity of the image while hiding information in a way that is imperceptible to the human eye.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Conceal text or binary data within standard image formats (e.g., BMP, PNG).
- Ensure that stego images remain visually indistinguishable from the original cover images.
- Provide reliable encoding and decoding functionality with basic error handling.

---

## Features

- **LSB Encoding & Decoding**: Bit-level embedding of secret data within image pixels.
- **Support for Text & Binary Files**: Handles both plain text and file-based data.
- **Preserves Image Quality**: Minimal to no perceptible change in output image.
- **Command-line Interface (CLI)**: Lightweight tool for integration into pipelines or manual use.

## Methodology

### Encoding Process
1. **Pre-processing**:
   - Read and validate input files (cover image and secret message).
   - Check capacity to ensure the image can accommodate the message.
2. **Embedding**:
   - Embed a predefined magic string to identify the start of hidden content.
   - Embed file extension, size, and message content using LSB manipulation of pixel bytes.
3. **Post-processing**:
   - Save the modified pixel data to generate the stego image.

### Decoding Process
1. **Validation**:
   - Read and validate the stego image.
2. **Extraction**:
   - Locate the magic string to identify the embedded data start point.
   - Extract file extension, size, and reconstruct the original message from LSBs.
3. **Output**:
   - Save the extracted content to a file.

## Input

- **Cover Image**: Input image used to conceal the message (`.bmp`, `.png`, etc.)
- **Secret Message**: File containing the message to be embedded (e.g., `secret.txt`)

## Output

- **Stego Image**: Image with embedded data (e.g., `stego.bmp`)
- **Decoded Message**: Extracted message or file retrieved during decoding

## How to Use
Encoding
```bash
./a.out -e <cover_image.bmp> <secret_file.txt>
```
## Decoding
```bash
./a.out -d <stego_image.bmp>
```
